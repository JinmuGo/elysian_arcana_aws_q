# Enemy Pixel Art for Elysian Arcana

This directory contains Python scripts to generate pixel art for the enemies in Elysian Arcana.

## Enemy Images

### Shadow Arcana
- First stage enemy
- Dark purple shadowy figure with glowing red eyes
- Features shadowy tendrils and a dark aura

### Reversed Magician
- Second stage enemy
- Dark blue robed figure with a magician's hat
- Features a staff with a glowing blue orb and magical particles

### Corrupted Empress
- Third stage enemy
- Dark red royal figure with a golden crown
- Features a scepter with a red orb and corruption effects

### Tower Guardian
- Final boss
- Yellowish stone golem with glowing yellow eyes
- Features cracks in the stone and lightning effects

## How to Generate Images

To generate these images, you need pygame installed:

```
pip install pygame
```

Then run the generation script:

```
python generate_enemies.py
```

This will create PNG files for each enemy in this directory.

## Manual Installation

If you can't run the generation script, you can manually create these images using any pixel art tool and save them with the following names:

- shadow_arcana.png
- reversed_magician.png
- corrupted_empress.png
- tower_guardian.png

Place these files in the `assets/images/enemies` directory for the game to find them.
